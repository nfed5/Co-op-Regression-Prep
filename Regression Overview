Linear Regression - a linear approximation of a causal relationship between two or more variables

Regression Process
1) Get Sample Data
2) Design a model that works for that sample
3) Make predictions for the whole population

Dependent variable (Y) - is predicted
Independent variables (Xs) - are predictors

Y is a function of Xs - Y = F(X1,X2,...Xk)

Simple Linear Regression Model

y^ = bo + b1x1 + e

y^ = prediction
bo = Constant
b1 = coefficient, quantifies the relationship between x1 and y
x1 = predictor
e = error of estimation

Simple Linear Regression Model Example

Income = bo + 5000Education + e

In this model: 
- For every additional year of education, Income is expected to increase by $5,000
- Bo equals the amount of Income if you had zero years of education
- error is the difference between observed income and the income the regression predicted
- on average, across all oberservations, the error is 0
- if you earn more than what the regression predicted, someone earns less, they even out

Correlation v. Regression
- Correlation measures the relationship between two variables and how they move together
- Regression measures how one variable affects another
- Correlation does not imply causation!!

Covariance - extent to which two random variables move together (+ number means they move in same direction, 
negative number means opposite directions)
Correlation - strength of relationship between two variables (+1 strong positive correlation, -1 strong negative correlation)
